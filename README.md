# stacheInBlog

A small full stack app. 
It checks if your user name and password are stored in the databas

If not it lets you know they are incorrect and then you should create a user(Stache Up)

Once you create a User it will prompt to the crossroads screen where you can blog about your luxurious mustache or you can choose an event to go to with you mustache pals.
